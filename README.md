# Task
Our team will be given a color code (more on this color code later) mid-flight by TEKNOFEST personnel. This code needs to be sent to our flight computer via ground station interface, which will then act accordingly.


# Color code
Color code is a 4 digit string in this format:
- 1st digit: Number between [1-9]. This number indicates the duration of the first filters color's activation.
- 2nd digit: Letter that is either R, G or B. This Letter indicates the first filter color.
- 3rd digit: Number between [1-9]. This number indicates the duration of the second filters color's activation.
- 4th digit: Letter that is either R, G or B. This Letter indicates the second filter color.

For example, 6G4B means filer disc will travel to green color, wait for 6 seconds, travel to blue color, wait for 4 seconds and travel back to neutral color.
