"""
In the move_step program, the first argument specifies how many steps to move.

If you want to change the parameters, go to module_file.

The 2nd and 3rd arguments are optional. If you set the 2nd argument to -1, it will move
in the reverse direction; if you set it to 1, it will move in the forward direction.
If you set the 3rd argument to 1, the motor will move without needing the first signal 
(whether the signal is a rising or falling edge). If you set it to 0,
it will not move until it receives the first signal.
